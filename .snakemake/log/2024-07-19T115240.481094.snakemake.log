Lints for rule fastp (line 24, /home/EVB_Scripts/Snakefile):
    * Do not access input and output files individually by index in shell commands:
      When individual access to input or output files is needed (i.e., just writing '{input}' is impossible), use names ('{input.somename}') instead of index based access.

    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover. In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become
      unreadable.

    * Specify a conda environment or container for each rule.:
      This way, the used software for each specific step is documented, and the workflow can be executed on any machine without prerequisites.
